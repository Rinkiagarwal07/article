Regulatory and Policy Initiatives: Various regulations and policies have been taken on plastic waste reduction and recycling by the Mexican government. For example, recently, the ban enforced upon single-use plastics in various states has accelerated the pace of growth toward sustainable packaging solutions. New regulations put pressure on businesses to engage in green packaging practices that meet new standards and avoid punitive measures.

Corporate Social Responsibility: Companies increasingly acknowledge the fact that CSR has grown and become one of those factors that have the potential to influence brand image. Green packaging would enhance the sustainability profile of the companies in Mexico by improving expectations and making products differentiated in the competitive market.
