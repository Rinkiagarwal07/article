Material Properties and Benefits

ASA plastic is preferred in automotive because of the following reasons:

UV Resistance: The ASA retains color and properties in sunlight, hence it can be used for automotive body parts.
Weather Resistance: It resists all types of weathering like rain, snow, and heat-cold cycles.
Impact Resistance: The ASA has a very high resistance to impact, hence it will help in making long-lasting radiator grills.
Aesthetic Flexibility: The material can easily be molded in a variety of shapes and finishes to add to the design features of the vehicle.
Applications

The most common use of ASA plastic in the automotive industry is for the production of radiator grills, although the material is also used in the manufacture of other exterior parts such as trim, bumpers, and mirror casings.
