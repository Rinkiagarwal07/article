Challenges Facing the US Office Chair Market
1. High Competition

The competition is pretty high in the office chair market because there are several players offering a wide product portfolio. This situation makes the differentiation of the product very difficult and it is hard to create a competitive advantage by the manufacturers regarding price, design, and features.
